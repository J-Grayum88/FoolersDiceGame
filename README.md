# FoolersDiceGame
My first somewhat independent project in the language C.
A game.  Five dice are rolled.  The user is told the value of three of them, two remain unknown.  
The user must then guess and place a bet on whether the next roll of five dice will have a higher, lower, or the same total.
There is also an easy and hard mode, with players being given the value of 4 and 2 dice, respectively, on the first roll.
